# url-exercise
This django app, I am going to create an exercise, which will help user to guess url endpoints. This exercise will help in increasing searching some contents, browsing through URL's as well as blog contents.

The examples and to built some application around this was part of one of the company level hackthon project.

I have used this repo https://github.com/qxf2/django-quiz-app to build this repo.
